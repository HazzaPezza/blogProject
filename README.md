# My Blog Project
This is my attempt at making a web blog using NodeJS as the baseline, I'm spending a little time each day adding to the blog.

# Requirements of the Project:
I'd like my project to be able to do the following:
  - Dynamically change size based on viewport size.
  - Post, Edit & Delete blog posts.
  - Dynamically bring up blog post data on template page.
  - Have an admin page to manage blog posts.
  - Ability to search blog posts.

At the moment the project is in early stages but I will update as I go along.
